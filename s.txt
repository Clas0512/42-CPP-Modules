back everyone um now it's time for uh our highlight presentation um really
looking forward to hear from uh Christian dla he's responsible for the
entire group of electric axle systems at shefer and I would say Christian welcome
to the stage
we just talked briefly before uh his presentation and whenever you have questions in between um we'll be ready
with a hand mic um just raise your hand and we can go over your question right
away thank you okay thank you yeah very warm welcome from my side I'm Christian
dler and as he introduced I'm responsible for product group Electric axle systems at
Sheffer and why I'm here today because I I want to introduce you what we are
doing at Sheffer um and why electrification is a good idea yeah these are the main
messages we start with a short company overview and uh at the end I will show
you also some kind of use cases for you yeah which kinds of product we are
dealing with so for the start I don't go to through all the numbers right I think
that's quite boring so you can see that all by your own um but the basic message
is uh we are big company we have a big Auditorium we have
tons of employees and uh who reads newspaper the last few
days um especially for emobility and for automotive business uh it seems like
that we are uh next year one company together with vesco yeah so this means
also from a strategic point of view we we really looking forward to be a a high
level system supplier for automotive
industry yeah and this is uh how we are today today we have uh three different
divisions Automotive Technologies automotive aftermarket and Industrial today as you heard uh from my
introduction of course I will focus on automotive
industry nevertheless um what was what are the roots of Sheffer I know if
everybody's aware on that and you don't have all to remember all these kind of
bearings here I do either not remember all of them um but Sheffer started with
bearings yeah so the success story started here in hats a with the
invention of the uh needle bearing and the cage and that's where Sheffer had
his first impact in automotive industry then we had acquisition of
other companies and uh like and and L and uh had a whole bunch of components
in automotive industry so that's really our past and for me it's important that you understand that Sheffer is a company
that does components for automotive industry very mechanically focused
yeah um maybe to make this a bit more interactive what do you think is the
smallest bearing one hint it's not Automotive the smallest inner diameter
of a bearing in the Sher portfolio give me a
guess I can't hear
it 1 mm damn you saw one of my presentations
before maybe because that's exactly right yeah it's 1 mm but no one of us
likes this bearing because it's from the drill of your dentist yeah so when you
are it it should work out yeah when you need it uh otherwise it
hurts what is the biggest
one very close four met for for wind
power drives yeah so but alone from that you can see in the in the sector of
components the range is huge yeah it is from really tiny engineering up to this
big uh bearings for for wind power
here there's an overview yeah as I said the three famous Brands Ena uh look and
F which uh uh provided this components for automotive industry I think we can
skip that and go to this very busy slide so what's the main message of these
slides um the message is and you are young uh engineering people talented
people yeah you are all aware that electrification uh will accelerate will
come more and more and it's a good idea yeah when I started with
electrification 2011 it was like uh we don't know yeah
maybe it's like the Internet it's just temporary and it will go away so today
these figures show that um the there is a big big increase of electrification in
the market out there and that people uh really need well
engineered electric axles or whatever kind of electrification you're looking
for so when a company like we are start
from mechanical components and want to go into this e Drive technology what's a good start
a good start you see in the corner on the left uh we started with
gearboxes and yeah we are also very proud about that because our first
gearboxes are for Porsche tyon uh uh developed for the E exle and
all the Audi Rons that are driving around out there so this was
really the first transmission system supplied from Sheffer and this was our
first step into the door into emobility but when you are good at
components the next step is quite obvious it's a motor
why you need a lot of electrical competence on motor that's true but
basically the manufacturing is classical mechanical engineering yeah so we tried
to use our or we used our knowledge for mechanical
engineering and uh provided Motors as well yeah and this goes on so I don't go
through all of these but this is just some kind of road map that you see there
is a transformation from a component supplier to a system supplier with very
complex systems as we will see and um that this
is some kind of a mixture of an evolution and a revolution solution yeah of course there are Fields where we have
not 50 years experience um but this makes it also
quite interesting yeah that you gather new knowledge that you learn and go into
new fields and by the way there is no one out there yeah with all this new
demands and requirements for e-mobility there is not this like in my case when I
talk about EX there is no company who says that's the perfect e Exel we are
finished yeah so there are tons of things to do and it's
always uh uh depends on the on the use case on the vehicle
Etc good now you see I already talked a lot about e drives so um we not do only
e drives we also have uh shassy division
yeah and in automotive industry who has the same path like we have yeah coming
from wheel bearings very mechanical stuff in the past and now go
into uh products like rear whe steering or or anti-roll stabilizers who are
already on the market um for example very very nice one I have I have driven
just a test car because I cannot afford it it's from bentle Ben Tiger but it's
very interesting this big SUV if you drive it with or without entry roll
stabilizer without is some kind of cheeky yeah at least if you like Fast
driving um with this with anti-roll stabilizer this very big car feels like
a sports car so also in very interesting products on the shassy
side okay this one we can go through uh uh

very quick the pie chart is the interesting one on on this slide because it tells also for for our business and I

just want to give you or send this message the Outlook that systems are

more and more important for us yeah and this changes so much you have another

you have totally different responsibilities as a system supplier and if complexity Rises of

course the efforts rise but they not rise linearly yeah they rise in an

exponential way so here there's a overview it's

basically from from for the group I'm responsible for I told you this message already we

start start with gearbox we go for two in one we call that in in our way uh the

combination with the electric motor we are now in development for fre in-one

systems very very different ones um so this means there's a Power Electronics

as well it's a full full drive drain and um this one go uh this will go

into production in 2025 and they are very different so I came back tonight

from from the US I had a business trip there and the difference couldn't be

bigger yeah so there are these drives like very tiny very smart Vehicles

autonomous driving not that powerful and there are of course like

the tradition of the US cars here very powerful big big big up trucks that that

needs to be electrified now as well so the the difference for electric Drive

drains is going uh bigger and bigger and with it the demands and

requirements on the right side um you can see the next one we called it here a

x in one axle it's sometimes funny with this nomenclature yeah uh like I think it was

B D they said ah look Sheffer has three in one axles and four in one axles we

have a eight or nine in one axle yeah but it's it's more or less a marketing

yeah it depends how many functions you introduce for all this uh uh to to count

on with all this so Eight in One axle yes they are right but they count DC DC

charger and what whatever is in their car yeah so I think this one is quite

straightforward you can remember 3in one ex is the entire system and then there

are more functions to add on um and by the way the right corner

one is one of the axles from the US market for pickup truck so they are very

big and heavy and it's totally a different way

so I asked a friend of Daimler truck if he's familiar with some so such kind of axles and he asked if I want to build uh

the Next Generation biggest truck on the world yeah in the US it's just a pickup

truck okay here we go down the system to to

Our Roots more or less the gearbox systems yeah where we started with uh uh

our path to e-mobility so this is already quite a complex one

and you can also strip that down to subsystems or even

components what is good here and what's an advantage of Sheffer we really do a lot of the

components by ourselves and this helps you a lot if

you are in Project work so I give you an example

um the customer is not satisfied with the nvh performance of your

gearbox Um this can happen because in immobility the requirements are very

high you should not hear that things so if you have now the parts that

are responsible for this nvh for the exitation of the the drivetrain is not

in your hand it's a mess yeah so you have to deal with many

interfaces many different components of course nobody did a mistake yeah if you

ask other people or the people from Gears will say oh that's the bearings

the people from bearings say oh that's the gears guys um so it makes a lot of sense and

gives you an big Advantage if you do that all by your own and can discuss it

in your own

Department here's one gearbox um we are very proud of so um as it began I said to you with

Audi rron we also have one hour Pace Award uh with that because of the high

power density so is the gearbox with if you make the ratio or the torque

density ratio for me is even more important so Newton met per kilogram

it's still the best gearbox that you can find out there um that's why we get this Pace

Award 2020 uh very similar one is in the Porsche so it's from our modular kit and

if you go out there I don't know if you have seen our eel there um it's quite

similar it's the next generation of this uh step planetary gear set with spur

gear differential okay um so that was a quite

interesting gearbox I have shown before why not only because of the Pace

Award uh people told me uh you will never sell that gearbox again so far too

high engineering efforts it's very small very compact a lot of uh uh uh

challenges because of ventilation lubrication and things like that um but nowadays it's our best sold

gearbox and we have it now in the third generation yeah so that's sometimes you

have to prove people that they are wrong yeah you just need need the the the right mindset on

that but we have also uh gearboxes like um most of the companies out there yeah

so if you look for E Exel typically is a offset design with spur sets so this is

something we developed really for the volume Market

yeah okay this was gearboxes so maybe I go go back again what message I want

send for gearboxes still even if some people think Ah that's the old world and you

guys from ex Exel some some transmission guys from the past year they have this

10speed automatic transmission they say this is not even a gearbox yeah it's

just a reducer just one speed but um I want to let you know that

there is still so much to explore and and to develop in terms of if efficiency

nvh and so on so it's really a a very

important subsystem for us that will be strengthened in the future

yeah then let's jump to the next subsystem of such an e axle or an

electric drivetrain yeah talk a lot about e Exel because I do that every day yeah but of course the same challenges

are with hybrid transmission or any kind of

electrification so the motor itself there are also interesting challenges

out there today most of the electric motors for E

axles or electric drivetrains are permanent Magnus Motors so they are synchronous Motors use permanent

magnets permanent magnets uh need some materials

that are not that easy to get or very expensive and it's also some kind of

political so you cannot get them anywhere on the planet at least not for

costs that make sense so that's why more and more people are looking for Motors that do not

depend on permanent magnets yeah yeah and here we have the electrically

excited synchronous motor so that the magnetic field is uh

generated by by current yeah flowing flowing to the

rotor or the induction motor yeah where the current is as it says where the

current and with it the magnetic field is induced into the

rotor it's not totally new yeah I think this concepts are

probably more than 100 years old or or known but not as we need them today yeah

so there is still a lot of challenges in terms of manufacturing make them more

efficient make them uh uh uh more lightweight and improve nvh capabilities

yeah but it's very interesting

that that's what I said at the beginning there is not this one way that works for

all even companies like Tesla started with uh some type of machines and then

changed yeah so they all try here a bit here a bit and and

um it really depends on the vehicles performance at the end of the day and the

requirement one thing that is quite interesting here it's uh by the way a new requirement for

any subsystem and for all of us it's um sustainability or here it's in the term

of CO2 so first customers start to ask us

hey okay I understood Sheffer your permanent magnet machine has that weight

and that performance and your IND ction motor is in comparison to that maybe as

you can see has less efficiency but is it more sustainable yeah and people start even

to pay a price on sustainability or our

customers so that's also very interesting because for the development

of such a drivetrain you all know that it's a very complex

system and you have to balance out all your parameters should it be the most

efficient One how can I manage nvh how can I manage lightweight costs but now

there's a new parameter yeah so complexity rises

again what our colleagues from bu ask me because of electric motors I I showed

that so we also invest heavily in in German

not only about engineering and development R&D for this kind of Motors

no we also built a a first class production that will produce his first

Motors uh soon or in a in a small series they all are already producing in bu so

it's in more or less south of carru in Barton wenberg so Sheffer invests a lot

in the production of electric motors in Europe and all over the globe yeah but

bu is really like a lighthouse for this kind of

production good because time time is running and we were late you don't have

to remember all this numbers the message I sent already so um the electric

drivetrains we provide start from very small ones for small

cars that yeah are very price sensitive up to sports cars um you will

the the project I'm most involved in at the moment will go in sop 2025 and I cannot wait for that because

I finally want to drive that car so I'm very happy when you or the next people

of your group when I can show that so it's very exciting if you like sports

cars and as I said also our uh rigid beam

axle um um that is like for small trucks delivery vehicles or in the US pickup

trucks so now I have a few slides on different electric Drive trains or E

Exel I will be quite fast on that they are just examples yeah you can also see

that afterwards uh in the presentation and and get a get a feeling about whatever

you're interested torque voltage whatever

um here I just want uh to give you that message that uh this is also the award

from from goldness lrat I don't I'm not sure I think it's from buildong in

Germany so probably not the most uh Professional Automotive

newspaper in the world I hope there is no one here from

buildong okay not um but anyhow yeah

it's it's again it's the same gearbox that won the the Pace Award and here is

the same we have a very lightweight and very small uh package e

Exel that fits into a lot of cars yeah and that gives you an

advantage this one is lightly bigger I I I said that also with the

with the story of A friend of mine from Daimler truck so totally different Market you have uh totally different for

example cooling requirements from for your motor because when this pickup

starts Towing on a hill in San Francisco yeah unit

torque and you have to be careful that your otor is not very soon just a very

very hot red piece of metal yeah so The Challenge on the other one

was uh more like for midsize SUV so totally different here you have really

to care about the strength of for but also cooling is a big topic because you

need this very very high

power I don't know if ah now it's working

again so now I have shown you some examples from the E exle Systems and how

different they are or how different electric Drive trins are so what are the next

steps um one next step we think about is what we call 4in one

system and 4in one system basically means that the thermal

management of a car is also included into the electric drivetrain so in the

frein one and this from an engineering point

of view can make sense yeah again this is not the best solution

for any application um but there are applications where it makes a lot of

sense and the idea is also to save some other

parts for example all of your cars have this PTC

heaters to heat up the fluid oil and things like that that you have some heat

available when you need for the cabin or or

whatever here we want to save this parts for 4 in one for example

to so we get the heat out of our electric

motor yeah so there are not other parts needed for that and it's very funny when

I go to the guys on our test R because since 2011 I go down there and say to

the them you have to make this e Drive more efficient yeah I want less uh heat

losses in my motor make it better work and when we started with 4 and one I

went downstairs to them and said you have to make this motor more inefficient

they were looking at me at the first moment what has he maybe one one beer too much

last night or bad sleep or what what is the problem with him it's really about um to make on

purpose higher heat losses yeah and use them for heating of the

cabin or any any other purpose yeah and that's a bit different also when we

think about battery electric vehicles because heat is so is of high value yeah

I said I was in the US when you have a pickup truck there with a 500 horsepowers

engine yeah you have enough heat in this car yeah because it's so it's not the

engine is not that efficient like an electric motor you have tons of heat and you can use it but in an electric car

heat has a very very high value so you should think about how to

use it in a efficient

manner good so so far I spoke a lot

about the drivetrain systems but even if this complexity is

already big there are all the small systems and they are

all have a high or they have all a high comp complexity by themselves like our

actuators for E Exel yeah here again is very good that we do

a lot of these things in house so there is another group that is dealing with

electric actuators yeah so you go downstairs or in another building and

there are colleagues they develop all the day a park loock activator for

example that needs to be integrated in the drivetrain and of course this is also a

system where we need people like you that is complex it has software it has

Electronics yeah it has mechanics and you have to bring them all

together working in a appropriate

Manner and I have shown for some examples that might be interesting for you for this kind of subsystems that are

integrated and um one of them I found was the the decoupling unit I don't know

if you heard about that so all people out there especially for

bef vehicles are looking for more efficiency why is

that of course efficiency means range and range is really a pain for so many

car manufacturers I remembered a few years ago there was one electric car

manufacturer uh from from California so

Tesla this had they had by far the highest range and it was really funny yeah

because because I had so much meetings with our customers from other car

manufacturers and the words they are using they get they got worse and worse

yeah because they had so much pressure to increase their range of the vehicles

and they could not do it at the beginning so they asked Mr dla we need a

e Exel that is a Tesla fighter yeah we want to build up a Tesla fighter who can

compete with this range years later same people came again Mr dler we need a

Tesla killer yeah it cannot go on that Tesla has still the highest

range so it was all about efficiency and uh people started to rethink how

increased that and one way to increase that is by

sometimes decoupling your electric drivetrain

so imagine you have a four-wheel drive electric vehicle and if it's not needed if you or

if one axle is not needed you just have a mechanical decoupling so it's more or

less de you need to know current to run it and also your gearbox nothing is

spinning and this is the idea of this uh decoupling units yeah some of them are

out in the market already for electric vehicles um some of them are even on the

market for internal combustion engine vehicles I think the Quattro Ultra Audi

Quattro Ultra has a system like that 10 years ago where they say okay if not

needed I have a front wheeel drive but if I want to drive my

Quattro um the vehicle will say to this to his rear axle okay okay let's connect

again and drive with all four wheels and that's basically the same

idea and here also enough challenges for a lot of Engineers yeah highly welcome

to join that field um it's very interesting we work a lot with some kind of dog clutches to do

that and the range is incredibly High yeah you can imagine if you want to do a

sports car the highest requirement is you press down the pedal and all your

wheels are on traction yeah so we are speaking about closing times of this do

clutch from 30 milliseconds yeah 30 to 50

so that's quite good um we have other requirements that

say for for other type of cars here make it not that noisy and make it most

comfortable for the driver so your decoupling looks totally

different yeah but all of them are interesting systems and we will see that more and

more another one is the talk

vectoring so I'm I'm sure also from from you guys there is some interest or from

some of you because mostly It's associated sometimes

we associate it with safe driving but mostly it has some kind of yeah better

driving in in sports more dyn better Dynamics right and for for for this

one I think we have an article very interesting one from Sheffer where we

introduced such a system in 2011 and no one was interested at that

time or there was interest but too expensive and not not well established

this talk vectoring things and it was in some kind of way

that you have in your gearbox an an additional overlapping gearbox if you

want yeah and you have a small motor with a small

electronics and that's how you can change your torque um for each

wheel at that time when we introduce that most of our customer said ah far

far too complicated um we do it very easy like with electric axles you can do one motor

per wheel yeah so your torque vectoring is not a mechanical part it's

just it's just electronically yeah you just have to control both Motors in a

proper way but now as we see there's also a

rethinking yeah because even software or Electronics uh need some

time so it's not that fast that it's the best way in each

situation and it's not um it's not as cost effective yeah

because you have this very big motor each wheel has this very big uh or has

an own gearbox so this twin axles they are out there like rron for example has also in

the most powerful uh uh vehicle such a twin

axle that can do torque vectoring by the way um but it's not the only one way yeah

people start to to rethink again this small electric motor that has an an

overlay in the gearbox and distributes the Torx how is

needed so there is more to come in the in the next few years because now I think electric cars or e-mobility really

has to figure it out how to make fast sports cars right you can

drive so much very exciting cars that are electric so I think the Next Generation

if all also in Germany our famous sports car

manufacturers want to differentiate them it's not only because of power and talk

of the drivve Trin but also from vehicle Dynamics yeah

and they talk vectoring will play an important role I

think okay to sum that up a little bit

um what does this slide mean it just means there

is a lot of variance and a lot of complex ability out there for electric

Drive trains yeah I tried to send this message here so we have so many

different motor Technologies gearbox Technologies Power Electronics

Technologies yeah now we have the shift from basically 400 volt to 800 volt will

be the new normal this changes things so there are so many different

variants that need to be engineered yeah and I

think that's why at least most of you are also here right

uh you want to engineer interesting products and I can just uh tell

you uh it's a good idea tons of work out there yeah to do amazing drivetrains and

amazing things in e-mobility

what competences are needed for that

um there are it's just a snapshot yeah there are a few competencies like a

classical one like for for components as well you

need Fe calculation yeah you

need nvh simulation and for systems you need requirements engineering and so on

so I don't go through all of them but I what I want to say is that there is so

much available you can contribute and also this tools um further develop yeah so it's

very interesting to be part of that we uh I I told you at the beginning

we had some challenges with this Audi gearboxes because they are so small and

have this power density and the oil was always there where you not need it yeah

um sometimes even it was out because the ventilation did not work it's so

compact we introduced a new simulation

method that is uh SP based yeah no classical cftd but smooth particle

hydrodynamics I maybe one of you deal some of you deal with

that and uh at the beginning all the all the people said oh that's that's Voodoo

what you're doing here yeah so nice nice picture and nice video but is this

really reality so as always when you are a Pioneer yeah many people ask many things

and ask you if you are sure about that I can tell you the same

people like also customers of us uh implemented three years later the same

software and have it now in their uh development process yeah so it's fixed

that for each sample phase you have this kind of

simulation and this is how things uh develop so you have not only the

opportunity to work on great products but also on great new methods and and

tools yeah and this is uh even as valuable valuable as on uh working on

the product this one is another snapshot

it's for for the tools we are using for the gearboxes themselves um probably

some of you have seen that as well but as you can see also in the middle of

this this is the front axle from the Audi rron it's a it's a offset design so

you can have here also an idea the bearings the gear so it's also a very

complex system that has so much influence on nvh Behavior

efficiency and so on um yeah these are the tools we are using

there so and that's why we talk about the free Columns of

simulation when we talk about it we simply mean there is the system design so

people are working on the product yeah make the right design of motor gearbox

whatever but we also have simulation more and more in production yeah also to

predict some behavior of some products n VH is a very nice

example and as I said an advantage is if you have it all in house yeah if you

deliver for example your gearbox and then your customer says oh your gearbox

is far too noisy I don't accept that and you have to go to your other supplier

and say there's something wrong with your nvh that can be a pain yeah and it takes quite a long

time so there is simulation also in terms of

of predicting the behavior of a part that is tested for example on a EOL yeah

to get sure that you have no um that you have no problems at the

end in the vehicle and last but not least this was the example with uh with SP is we call

it Knowledge Management so when I started at cheffer Knowledge Management was quite of often

that you have some very experienced and good Engineers yeah and how do you as a

company conserve knowledge so they teached it to the young Engineers but

you really relied on persons yeah and what changes here a little bit is how

can you not only rely on Persons but also on the tools you're using on the

parameters you have find out on simulation on methodologies and so

on so there was really a good example how we um conserved this kind of

knowledge so this was from engineering competencies a small snapshot what is

needed now the question where it is needed

so we are a global company as introduced for emobility there is uh the

headquarter in bu for automotive Technologies there's the headquarter in

bu um hat a as we are today plays as the

global headquarter an important role and we are also the headquarter for E Exel if you want e Exel

systems and then we have some other sides yeah like in China of course the electric

vehicle market and the electrification is a big topic yeah so you have the opportunity for example uh in anting

that's quite close to Shanghai we have a new one in

xiangtan and on the other side in the US we are in

wer that is Ohio that's another quite big development team where we are

focused pretty much on this uh rigid beam axles for pickups as you have

seen so these are the biggest sides but also here in in Eastern Europe we build

up for example Hungary in somat we have a big otor manufacturing that

started or our colleagues for electric axle are in Slovakia in kizut

where we have already a team of 70

people good this was the presentation so on this sides I would love I think I cannot

remember all of your faces I have seen some now but uh yeah it's pretty hard

for me to remember all of them but I would be very happy if I can

see some of you in one of these locations working on exciting products

yeah I think what you are doing here is a very very good thing so that you are

engaged in something like FSG yeah so you are on the right path and I wish you

all the best a good day a fruitful career and would be of course very very

happy when it is with Sher thank [Applause]

you okay thank you very much Christian do we have questions from the

audience thank you um would you say that the future only lies in e-mobility

or and we are curious to know what your thoughts on on the future of hydrogen

Mobility together with e-mobility okay very good one also a political one

so um I would start with that I think electrification is a good idea yeah so

any kind of electrification improves efficiency and when when I started in

2011 the was even in question yeah people thought this is not necessary I

think this is not a question anymore but for sure there are some vehicles or

applications where a internal combustion engine can help yeah as I I was in the

US so there are people want to tow a very big boat for 500

kilometers if you don't want to tow a very big battery as well you have to use

an internal combustion engine for help yeah but basically I think to your

question immobility will rise and will get more and more important but the internal combustion engine will

not uh disappear very very soon I'm so happy that I'm with e axles because for

me it doesn't matter if the current comes out from the battery or from from a fuel cell yeah I don't care and in a

professional life but my opinion is for hydrogen in cars I think it will be very

very hard for them to long distance I think there is some future but I

cannot believe that we will see like a car like uh BMW fre Series yeah that you

will have a lot of hydrogen cars for for that kind of

vehicles okay thank you do we have other questions from the

audience if not I would personally have one um this maybe also on behalf of all

our students and you touch based on that briefly in your presentation and the question is about when you're looking to

hiring new Engineers um what are the the key skills soft skills that you're

looking for as of right now and then maybe projecting this into like the next five years because everyone who is here

right now still has at least one more year of formul student and then looking

properly into either internships um thesis work or like even job start

yeah yeah that's that's a perfect question to say you have to stay with

FSG right so but these are exactly uh

soft skills uh like that so of course it helps a lot for for us if you have

somehow your your feis yeah on a topic that is related to the topics we deal

with yeah that always makes it easier um but that's some kind of

technical skill I think you can learn that so it's not a a musthave what's for

us a must have if you have that is that you have this kind of um interest in

such kind of products yeah and also I would say some kind of ownership yeah

that you really want to to work on that and be responsible for the things you're

working on so this are because you ask for soft skills here um that are very

important for us other things like you simulate the magnetic field of

a permanent magnet rotor that's very nice if you can if you have done that

before then we are very fast to keep you running on that but if you if not we can

learn that soft skills it's a bit different sometimes you cannot learn that yeah or it's it takes much longer

so things like FSG help a lot to see that you are engaged in the topic and

that you want to work on it and change something in

this world yeah and I think think this gives you a big credit on

that very good thank you okay I think it's uh quarter past 12 um time's up

Christian thank you again very much for your presentation thank you and for being here on stage thank

you
